# User-Experience 
Project Outcomes:

To design a game that is fun and interactive.

To design a game that is easy to follow without much need for explaination or instructions. A game that anyone of all ablities can pick up and play.

To create a website that is a good experience for users with easy to read text and good accesibilty.

# User-Stories:
I would like a game that is fun and makes me want to play it again. 

I would like a website with a game thats easy to understand and without complicated instructions. A game that suits all ages and ablities.

I would like a game that is fast pace and accessible.

# Features 
1. Buttons for Rock, Paper and Scissors. 
2. A game logo. 
3. Rock, Paper and Scissors icons. 
This will help this know which button to click. This is helper if they have only been used to an in person version of this game.
4. A leaderboard display which updates in real time.
5. Sound effects on button clicks to add to user-experience along with button grow and shrink animation.
6. An alert for the user when the game ends to stop game play.

# Structure-Plan:
The web page will contain three buttons for Rock, Paper and Scissors in the centre. It will display a question 'Rock, Paper or Scissors?...' Which encourages the user to click a button and play the game. The results will be added up on the leaderboard and users can refresh the page to start again.
The page will have a cartoon logo which represents Rock, Paper and Scissors to add to the overall desgin look. 
The game will have sound effects on the buttons to make the page more fun and interactive. 

# Wireframes 

For the design plan, I decided to design for mobile first. This is because most of my users will play the game on a mobile. The game is small so it suits the mobile screen well. 
For the logo I created a design on canva. I wanted it to be fun and a bit different from the normal emoji-looking logo's that you might get for this particular game.

# Design-and-Color-Scheme

I decided that I wanted purple to be the main color, and have white text so that there is a strong contrast from the dark background. 
The pink for the buttons was added later so that it was less plain.

# Testing-and-Results 
Strategy:
As this is a game built in Javascript, a lot of my testing comes from user interation. Therefore I sent it to my peers and friends to look at and give me feedback on. 
I then put a google document together of testing expetations and results. Then on that document if there was any action taken or bugs unfixed.
I then passed my code through the relevent validators and noted those results below.

Summary:
My Rock, Paper, Scissors game is fun and interative. The button animation and sound effects adds to the overall user experience. 
The game condition works and there weren't major issues found with the game. 

Testing Results:
I have created this document where my testing can be viewed.
